## Simple sampling: systematic sample

* Determine a **sampling interval**

$$ \text{sampling interval} ~ = ~ \left \lfloor \frac{\text{number of samples needed}}{\text{total number of population}} \right \rfloor $$

* Select a random number from the series of numbers between 1 and the sampling interval. This will be the **random starting point** for the systematic selection.

* Using the **random starting point** and the **sampling interval**, select the samples from a list of all members of the population starting from the random starting point position and then for every successive sampling interval position.

# Complex sample

## Complex survey design: two-stage/multi-stage random cluster sample

* First stage sample - sampling of clusters

    * draw a simple random sample of X clusters
    * draw a systematic sample of X clusters
    * draw a sample of X number of clusters selected proportional to population size

* Second stage sample - within-cluster sampling

    * draw a simple random sample of Y members of the selected clusters
    * draw a systematic sample of Y members of the selected clusters
    * draw a spatial sample of Y members of the selected clusters

## Spatial sampling

* techniques such as Centric Systematic Area Sampling (CSAS) are known to approximate a simple random sample

* useful as an alternative to other sampling approaches particularly when typical sampling frames are not available

.pull-left[
* no readily available sampling frame

* sample of both households and livestock

* also includes soil samples
